Icon Pack For Code Editors
==========================

A small collection of icons I created to use in the TextMate code editor.

The collection includes most popular files types used by web developers:

BZIP, CONF, CSS, DATABASE, GZIP, HTML, INI, JAVASCRIPT, JSON, PLAIN, PYTHON, RSS, SH, SQL, TAR, TEMPLATE, TXT, XML, ZIP

I've included the original PSD to generate the icons. Make sure you have the [04b-03][0] font in your library when making changes.

Textmate
--------

To use the icons in TexMate verion 1.x copy the icons inside the app:

	TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/File\ Icons/

Make sure you first make a backup of TextMate before you overwrite replace the stock icons. I Haven't tried this with version 2.x.
